<h1>Collections</h1>

<p>A collection is a user-defined collection of <a href="objects.htm">scene objects</a>. Both collections and scene objects are <a href="entities.htm">entities</a>. Collections are useful when referring to several objects like a robot for instance, when performing a specific operation, such as <a href="collisionDetection.htm">checking for collision</a> between two robots: if a collision detection pair was defined as (collectionRobot1; collectionRobot2), then the collision checking algorithm would check whether any object from the first collection interferes with any object from the second collection.<br>
</p>

<p>Collections are <a href="collidableObjects.htm">collidable</a>, <a href="measurableObjects.htm">measurable</a>, <a href="detectableObjects.htm">detectable</a><!--, <a href="cuttableObjects.htm">cuttable</a>--> and <a href="renderableObjects.htm">renderable</a> entities. This means that collections:<br>
</p>

<li>can be used in <a href="collisionDetection.htm">collision detections</a> against other collidable entities.<br>
</li>

<li>can be used in <a href="distanceCalculation.htm">minimum distance calculations</a> with other measurable entities.<br>
</li>

<li>can be detected by <a href="proximitySensors.htm">proximity sensors</a>. </li>

<!--
<li>can be cut by <a href="mills.htm">mills</a>. </li>
-->

<li>can be detected or <em>seen</em> by <a href="visionSensors.htm">vision sensors</a>. </li>


<p>Even if a collection is collidable, measurable, detectable<!--, cuttable--> and renderable, this doesn't mean that all objects contained in the collection are collidable, measurable, detectable<!--, cuttable--> or renderable:<br>
</p>


<li>During collision detection, only the collidable objects of a collection (subset of the collection) are tested against another collidable entity.<br>
</li>

<li>During distance measurement, only the measurable objects of a collection (subset of the collection) are measured against another measurable entity.<br>
</li>

<li>Only the detectable objects of a collection (subset of the collection) can be detected by proximity sensors.<br>
</li>

<!--
<li>Only the cuttable objects of a collection (subset of the collection) can be cut by mills.<br>
</li>
-->

<li>Only the renderable objects of a collection (subset of the collection) can be detected by vision sensors.<br>
</li>


<p>A collection can however override the collidable, measurable, detectable<!--, cuttable--> and renderable properties of its objects.<br>
</p>

<p>A collection is defined by one or several items that can be combined in an additive or subtractive manner. Following items are supported:</p>

<li>a single object</li>
<li>a tree of objects: this item represents all descendants of a single object (located at the tree root). If the tree grows or shrinks, the item will dynamically grow/shrink too.</li>
<li>a chain of objects: this represents all objects encountered when following all ancestors of a single object, If the chain grows or shrinks, the item will dynamically grow/shrink too.</li>
<li>all scene objects</li>
<p>A collection is not static, and is constantly evaluated/updated to determine its containing objects. A given collection can also be defined in many different ways, depending on specific needs:</p>

<p align=center><img src="images/collections.jpg"></p>
<p class=imageLabel>[Example collection containing 4 objects (the colored objects]</p>
<br>

<p>Above collection could be defined as a combination of 4 items, resulting in following code:</p>

<pre class=lightRedBox>
-- Collection defined as: &lt;object2&gt; + &lt;object4&gt; + &lt;object6&gt; + &lt;object7&gt;

local object2=sim.getObjectHandle('object2')
local object4=sim.getObjectHandle('object4')
local object6=sim.getObjectHandle('object6')
local object7=sim.getObjectHandle('object7')
collectionHandle=sim.createCollection(0)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_single,object2,0)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_single,object4,0)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_single,object6,0)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_single,object7,0)</pre>

<p>But a similar collection could also be defined as a combination of following 3 items too:</p>

<pre class=lightRedBox>-- Collection defined as: &lt;all objects&gt; - &lt;tree starting at object1&gt; + &lt;object6&gt;

local object1=sim.getObjectHandle('object1')
local object6=sim.getObjectHandle('object6')
collectionHandle=sim.createCollection(0)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_all,-1,0)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_tree,object1,1)
sim.addItemToCollection(collectionHandle,sim.handle_single,object6,0)</pre>
